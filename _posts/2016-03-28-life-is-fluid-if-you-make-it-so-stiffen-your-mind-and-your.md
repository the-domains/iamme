_One in five Australians aged 16-85 experience mental illness in any year, the most common; depression, anxiety and substance use disorder. These three often occur in combination. Almost half (45%) of Australians will experience mental illness in their lifetime._

Before I decline to answer these questions, well, how can I answer them? I'm not entirely sure which side of the statistic I reside but I can confirm one thing, I wrote the opening paragraph and you read it the way it was intended.
